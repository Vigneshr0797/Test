Here’s a simpler and more straightforward version of the mail:

:::writing{id=“68422” variant=“email” subject=“Update Required: JaCoCo Configuration in pom.xml”}
Hi Team,

The JaCoCo code coverage plugin in Jenkins has been deprecated. Because of this, code coverage must now be configured directly in the pom.xml file.

I have shared the JaCoCo plugin configuration that needs to be added.
Please update this configuration in the pom.xml of all APIs so that code coverage is correctly tracked in SonarQube.

Kindly complete the update and confirm once done.

Thanks & Regards,
Villa

You’re hitting a classic SSL trust issue between Jenkins (on-prem) and Jira.
The screenshots clearly show the root cause 👇

⸻

🔴 Root Cause (Confirmed from logs)

sun.security.provider.certpath.SunCertPathBuilderException:
unable to find valid certification path to requested target

This means:

👉 Jenkins JVM does NOT trust Jira’s SSL certificate
👉 Usually happens when Jira uses:
	•	Internal CA
	•	Self-signed certificate
	•	Corporate proxy SSL certificate

Because of this, Jenkins cannot validate Jira, and the UI throws “Oops! A problem occurred”.

⸻

✅ What exactly is failing?
	•	Jenkins version: 2.545
	•	Error occurs when validating Jira connection
	•	Jenkins REST call → Jira HTTPS endpoint
	•	JVM truststore does not contain Jira’s CA cert

This is NOT:
	•	Jenkins bug
	•	Jira plugin bug
	•	Network issue

⸻

🛠️ PERMANENT FIX (Recommended)

Step 1: Export Jira SSL certificate

From Jenkins server:

openssl s_client -connect jira.company.com:443 -showcerts </dev/null

Copy the root or intermediate certificate
Save it as:

jira.crt


⸻

Step 2: Import certificate into Jenkins JVM truststore

Find Jenkins Java:

readlink -f $(which java)

Example truststore path:

$JAVA_HOME/lib/security/cacerts

Default password: changeit

keytool -importcert \
-alias jira-cert \
-file jira.crt \
-keystore $JAVA_HOME/lib/security/cacerts

Type yes when prompted.

⸻

Step 3: Restart Jenkins

systemctl restart jenkins

(or restart container if Jenkins is containerized)

⸻

Step 4: Validate Jira again

Go to:

Manage Jenkins → Configure System → Jira

✅ Validation should succeed
✅ No more “Oops!” screen

⸻

⚠️ TEMPORARY WORKAROUND (NOT recommended for PROD)

Option 1: Disable SSL verification (if plugin supports it)

Some Jira plugins have:

☑ Disable SSL certificate validation

Use ONLY for testing.

⸻

Option 2: Use JVM arg (VERY risky)

-Dcom.sun.net.ssl.checkRevocation=false

❌ Weakens security
❌ Not acceptable in enterprise setups

⸻

🧠 Why this happened now?

Common triggers:
	•	Jira SSL cert renewed
	•	CA chain changed
	•	Jenkins Java upgraded
	•	Jenkins moved to new server

⸻

✅ Final Recommendation (Enterprise Safe)

✔ Import Jira CA certificate into Jenkins JVM
✔ Restart Jenkins
✔ Revalidate Jira

This is the correct and audit-safe fix.

⸻

If you want, tell me:
	•	Is Jira Cloud or Data Center?
	•	Is Jenkins VM or Docker?
	•	Do you use corporate proxy SSL?

I’ll tailor the exact command for your setup 👍

You can extract the Jira SSL certificate directly as a .crt file from your Jenkins server (or any Linux box) in one clean command. Below are 3 reliable methods — use Method 1 (recommended).

⸻

✅ Method 1: Directly download Jira cert as .crt (BEST)

Run this on the Jenkins server:

echo | openssl s_client -connect jira.company.com:443 -servername jira.company.com \
  | sed -ne '/-BEGIN CERTIFICATE-/,/-END CERTIFICATE-/p' > jira.crt

✔ Creates jira.crt directly
✔ Works for self-signed & internal CA
✔ No browser required

Verify:

openssl x509 -in jira.crt -text -noout


⸻

✅ Method 2: Export from browser (Manual)

If you can open Jira in a browser:

Chrome / Edge
	1.	Open https://jira.company.com
	2.	Click 🔒 → Connection is secure
	3.	Certificate → Details
	4.	Export → Base-64 encoded X.509 (.CER)
	5.	Rename:

mv jira.cer jira.crt

⚠️ Make sure you export the Root or Intermediate CA, not only the leaf cert.

⸻

✅ Method 3: Get FULL certificate chain (Recommended for corp PKI)

If your Jira uses a corporate CA, extract all certs:

openssl s_client -connect jira.company.com:443 -showcerts </dev/null

Then split them:

awk '/BEGIN CERTIFICATE/{i++}{print > "jira-chain-" i ".crt"}' <(openssl s_client -connect jira.company.com:443 -showcerts </dev/null)

Import root + intermediate, not the leaf cert.

⸻

🔐 Import into Jenkins Java truststore

keytool -importcert \
-alias jira-ca \
-file jira.crt \
-keystore $JAVA_HOME/lib/security/cacerts

Password:

changeit

Restart Jenkins:

systemctl restart jenkins


⸻

🧠 How to know which cert to import?

Run:

openssl s_client -connect jira.company.com:443 -showcerts

If you see:

Verify return code: 20 (unable to get local issuer certificate)

👉 Import Root CA

If:

Verify return code: 21 (unable to verify first certificate)

👉 Import Intermediate CA

⸻

🚨 Common Mistake (causes SAME error again)

❌ Importing only the leaf certificate
❌ Importing into wrong Java (root vs jenkins Java)
❌ Restarting Jenkins not done

⸻

✅ TL;DR (Fastest)

echo | openssl s_client -connect jira.company.com:443 \
| sed -ne '/BEGIN CERTIFICATE/,/END CERTIFICATE/p' > jira.crt


⸻

If you tell me:
	•	Jenkins is Docker / VM
	•	Jira is Cloud / DC
	•	Java version (java -version)

I’ll give you the exact truststore path to avoid mistakes.
