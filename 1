Here’s a simpler and more straightforward version of the mail:

:::writing{id=“68422” variant=“email” subject=“Update Required: JaCoCo Configuration in pom.xml”}
Hi Team,

The JaCoCo code coverage plugin in Jenkins has been deprecated. Because of this, code coverage must now be configured directly in the pom.xml file.

I have shared the JaCoCo plugin configuration that needs to be added.
Please update this configuration in the pom.xml of all APIs so that code coverage is correctly tracked in SonarQube.

Kindly complete the update and confirm once done.

Thanks & Regards,
Villa

You’re hitting a classic SSL trust issue between Jenkins (on-prem) and Jira.
The screenshots clearly show the root cause 👇

⸻

🔴 Root Cause (Confirmed from logs)

sun.security.provider.certpath.SunCertPathBuilderException:
unable to find valid certification path to requested target

This means:

👉 Jenkins JVM does NOT trust Jira’s SSL certificate
👉 Usually happens when Jira uses:
	•	Internal CA
	•	Self-signed certificate
	•	Corporate proxy SSL certificate

Because of this, Jenkins cannot validate Jira, and the UI throws “Oops! A problem occurred”.

⸻

✅ What exactly is failing?
	•	Jenkins version: 2.545
	•	Error occurs when validating Jira connection
	•	Jenkins REST call → Jira HTTPS endpoint
	•	JVM truststore does not contain Jira’s CA cert

This is NOT:
	•	Jenkins bug
	•	Jira plugin bug
	•	Network issue

⸻

🛠️ PERMANENT FIX (Recommended)

Step 1: Export Jira SSL certificate

From Jenkins server:

openssl s_client -connect jira.company.com:443 -showcerts </dev/null

Copy the root or intermediate certificate
Save it as:

jira.crt


⸻

Step 2: Import certificate into Jenkins JVM truststore

Find Jenkins Java:

readlink -f $(which java)

Example truststore path:

$JAVA_HOME/lib/security/cacerts

Default password: changeit

keytool -importcert \
-alias jira-cert \
-file jira.crt \
-keystore $JAVA_HOME/lib/security/cacerts

Type yes when prompted.

⸻

Step 3: Restart Jenkins

systemctl restart jenkins

(or restart container if Jenkins is containerized)

⸻

Step 4: Validate Jira again

Go to:

Manage Jenkins → Configure System → Jira

✅ Validation should succeed
✅ No more “Oops!” screen

⸻

⚠️ TEMPORARY WORKAROUND (NOT recommended for PROD)

Option 1: Disable SSL verification (if plugin supports it)

Some Jira plugins have:

☑ Disable SSL certificate validation

Use ONLY for testing.

⸻

Option 2: Use JVM arg (VERY risky)

-Dcom.sun.net.ssl.checkRevocation=false

❌ Weakens security
❌ Not acceptable in enterprise setups

⸻

🧠 Why this happened now?

Common triggers:
	•	Jira SSL cert renewed
	•	CA chain changed
	•	Jenkins Java upgraded
	•	Jenkins moved to new server

⸻

✅ Final Recommendation (Enterprise Safe)

✔ Import Jira CA certificate into Jenkins JVM
✔ Restart Jenkins
✔ Revalidate Jira

This is the correct and audit-safe fix.

⸻

If you want, tell me:
	•	Is Jira Cloud or Data Center?
	•	Is Jenkins VM or Docker?
	•	Do you use corporate proxy SSL?

I’ll tailor the exact command for your setup 👍
